# PowerShell Active Directory Reconnaissance Script (`AD_recon.ps1`)

This script is designed for initial **Active Directory (AD) enumeration** during penetration tests or red team engagements. It automates the process of gathering crucial information about the domain, its computers, users, and especially privileged groups like "Domain Admins".

## üöÄ Features

* **Automated PowerView Integration:**
    * Checks for the presence of `PowerView.ps1` locally.
    * **Downloads `PowerView.ps1`** directly from the official PowerSploit GitHub repository if it's not found, ensuring necessary tools are available on the target.
    * Imports PowerView to enable its powerful AD enumeration cmdlets.
* **Comprehensive AD Data Collection:**
    * Gathers **general domain information** using `Get-NetDomain`.
    * Enumerates a detailed list of **domain computers** with `Get-NetComputer -FullData`.
    * Lists all **domain users** with detailed attributes using `Get-NetUser -FullData`.
    * Identifies **members of the 'Domain Admins' group** using `Get-NetGroupMember`, a critical step for privilege escalation paths.
* **Clear Output:**
    * Displays all collected AD reconnaissance data directly in the **PowerShell console**.
    * The report is formatted for easy readability.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the `AD_recon.ps1` file to your target machine.
2.  **Transfer to Target:** Get the `.ps1` file onto the system where you want to perform the reconnaissance.
3.  **Execute:** Open a PowerShell console on the target and run the script:

    ```powershell
    .\AD_recon.ps1
    ```

    * **Execution Policy Note:** If PowerShell's execution policy prevents the script from running, you might need to bypass it:
        ```powershell
        powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\AD_recon.ps1
        ```
    * **Stealthier Execution:** For more covert operations, consider encoding this script to Base64 (using a tool like `encode_and_execute_b64.ps1` from this repository) and executing it with `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand`.
