# PowerShell Base64 Encoder & Executor

This PowerShell script provides a convenient way to encode any `.ps1` script into a Base64 string, which can then be executed via `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand`. This technique is commonly used to bypass basic signature-based antivirus detections and to obfuscate script content during command-line execution.

## üöÄ Features

* **Script Encoding:** Takes a PowerShell script file (`.ps1`) as input and converts its content to a Base64 string.
* **UTF-16LE (Unicode) Encoding:** Ensures compatibility with PowerShell's `-EncodedCommand` parameter, which specifically expects Unicode-encoded input.
* **Ready-to-Use Command:** Outputs the full `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand` line, making it easy to copy and paste for immediate use.
* **Execution Policy Bypass Suggestion:** Provides an example command that includes common bypass techniques (`-ep bypass -w hidden -nop`) for stealthier execution in various environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the `encode_and_execute_b64.ps1` file to your local machine.
2.  **Edit the Input Path:** Open `encode_and_execute_b64.ps1` in a text editor (like VS Code or Notepad).
    * Locate the line `$InputFilePath = "C:\Path\To\your_script.ps1"`.
    * **Change `C:\Path\To\your_script.ps1`** to the *actual full path* of the PowerShell script you want to encode (e.g., your reverse shell script like `powershell_reverse_shell_byte_stream.ps1`).

    ```powershell
    # Example:
    $InputFilePath = "C:\Users\YourUser\Desktop\your_reverse_shell.ps1"
    ```

3.  **Run the Encoder:** Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you saved `encode_and_execute_b64.ps1`. Then execute it:

    ```powershell
    .\encode_and_execute_b64.ps1
    ```

4.  **Get the Output:** The script will output the Base64 string and the full command-line to execute it. Copy this command.

    ```
    --- Starting Base64 Encoding ---

    [+] PowerShell Script Encoded to Base64 Successfully!

    --- Execution Command ---
    Use the following command to execute the Base64 encoded script:
       powershell.exe -EncodedCommand <your_very_long_base64_string_here>

    Note: For remote execution or in scenarios where PowerShell's execution policy is restricted,
          you might need to add '-ep bypass -w hidden -nop' parameters:
       powershell.exe -ep bypass -w hidden -nop -EncodedCommand <your_very_long_base64_string_here>
    ```

5.  **Execute the Encoded Command:** Paste the copied command into a target PowerShell console or command prompt (if authorized) to execute your original script without directly calling the `.ps1` file.

While Base64 encoding can bypass some basic security measures, it's generally *not* sufficient to evade modern EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) or advanced antivirus solutions, which often detect malicious behavior upon execution, regardless of the encoding.
